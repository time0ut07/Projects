# raspberry-pi


Owning a RaspBerry-Pi (RPI) 4, I have use it for many different stuff like ad-blocker, password storage , and VPN, while adding defensive measures such as intrusion detection system and honey ports to protect my RPI (for fun), I will be uploading the scripts I used in this folder.


### failed_login.py
Using the library twilio, I created a simple python script where if a there was a unsuccessfully SSH login attempt, the server will send me a SMS where I will know their IP address, port used, user account attempt, and timestamp.
