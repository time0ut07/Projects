# Projects

This is where I will put my own self-initiated projects.
All these projects are just for fun, just hoping to learn more and create something in the field of study that I am interested in!


## C2-Server
During the year 2 holiday (before going to year 3), I spent a bit of my time building a simple C2-server in python. It have many functionalities like getting information of the client machine and using the command prompt of the machine. 

I am completely new to these kind of stuff therefore the C2-server should be quite bad (or just trash). I did it just for fun and as long as it works and acts like c2-server, I'm fine with it. However, after I gain more knowledge, I would like to really build a full scale c2-server where people will use it in the real world.


# RaspBerry-Pi
Owning a RaspBerry-Pi (RPI) 4, I have use it for many different stuff like ad-blocker, password storage , and VPN, while adding defensive measures such as intrusion detection system and honey ports to protect my RPI (for fun), I will be uploading the scripts I used in this folder.


# Anki
Coded this flashcard CLI when I was relatively new to coding. Works pefectly fine as a flashcard but could make more QOL changes.


# Block Chain
Coded this by myself for a module presentation demonstration of blockchain and simulated a simple attack.
